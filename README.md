# Campus Wi-Fi Network Optimizer  
*A Graph-Based Network Design & Optimization Tool*

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Campus Wi-Fi Network Optimizer** is a graph-based system designed to analyze, optimize, and visualize campus Wi-Fi infrastructure. It ensures reliable connectivity using classical **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, including:

- **Kruskal’s & Prim’s Algorithms** → Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)  
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** → Shortest latency path  
- **BFS & DFS** → Connectivity and fault tolerance  

The **backend is implemented in C**, while the **frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, replacing the earlier Tkinter-based GUI.

  - **CSS** (styling)
  - **JavaScript** (logic + graph visualization)
- Displays:
  - Raw graph  
  - MST  
  - Shortest path  
  - Node/edge weights  

### 🔹 Backend

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Data Input
- User enters buildings, distances, cable costs, and connections via the GUI.
- Data is sent to the C backend for processing.

### 2️⃣ Graph Construction
- Backend builds a weighted adjacency list representing the campus layout.

### 3️⃣ Algorithm Execution
- **MST** → Minimum cabling cost  
- **Dijkstra** → Optimal latency path  
- **BFS/DFS** → Connectivity verification  

### 4️⃣ Output & Visualization
- Frontend receives results and displays:
  - Raw input graph  
  - MST  
  - Shortest path  
  - Connectivity results
