# WiFi-Optimizer-MST-
This repository contains an implementation of a WiFi Optimiser with a core focus on handling and constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from a given graph structure in C. 

The MST handling module in this project:
-> Accepts a graph representation of WiFi nodes and possible connections.
-> Applies classical MST algorithms (like Kruskal’s or Prim’s) to determine the optimal spanning structure.
-> Outputs the MST along with the total cost, which represents the most efficient way to connect all access points without redundancy.
